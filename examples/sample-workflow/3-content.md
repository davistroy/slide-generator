# Slide 1: Title

## Title
Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Subtitle
A Practical Introduction for Technical Beginners

## Speaker Notes
Welcome everyone. Today we'll explore machine learning from the ground up, focusing on practical understanding rather than mathematical complexity.

# Slide 2: What is Machine Learning?

## Title
What is Machine Learning?

## Bullets
- Algorithms that learn patterns from data
- Improves automatically through experience
- Makes predictions without explicit programming
- Foundation of modern AI applications

## Speaker Notes
Machine learning differs from traditional programming. Instead of writing explicit rules, we provide examples and let the algorithm discover patterns. [cite-001]

## Graphics Description
A split comparison showing traditional programming (rules + data = output) versus machine learning (data + output = rules), using clean iconographic style with blue and white color scheme.

# Slide 3: Why ML Matters

## Title
Why Machine Learning Matters

## Bullets
- Powers recommendations you see daily (Netflix, Amazon)
- Enables voice assistants and language translation
- Drives autonomous vehicle development
- Revolutionizes healthcare diagnostics

## Speaker Notes
Machine learning isn't just academic—it's integrated into products you use every day. Understanding ML helps you leverage these tools effectively.

## Graphics Description
A grid of 4 icons representing key ML applications: a play button for streaming, a microphone for voice assistants, a car for autonomous vehicles, and a heart for healthcare.
