# Development Dependencies for Slide Generator
# ============================================
# These are additional tools for development, testing, and code quality.
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# For production use, only requirements.txt is needed.

# Code Formatting and Linting
# ----------------------------
# These tools help maintain consistent code style and catch common errors

# Black: The uncompromising Python code formatter
# Automatically formats code to a consistent style
# Usage: black presentation-skill/lib/*.py
black>=23.0.0

# Ruff: An extremely fast Python linter
# Replaces flake8, isort, and several other tools
# Usage: ruff check presentation-skill/
ruff>=0.1.0

# Type Checking
# -------------
# Mypy: Static type checker for Python
# Catches type errors before runtime
# Usage: mypy presentation-skill/lib/ --ignore-missing-imports
mypy>=1.0.0

# Testing
# -------
# Pytest: Testing framework
# Makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex testing
# Usage: pytest tests/
pytest>=7.0.0

# Pytest-cov: Coverage plugin for pytest
# Measures how much of your code is covered by tests
# Usage: pytest --cov=presentation-skill --cov-report=html
pytest-cov>=4.0.0

# Security
# --------
# Pip-audit: Tool for scanning Python environments for known vulnerabilities
# Checks dependencies against a database of security issues
# Usage: pip-audit
pip-audit>=2.0.0

# Safety: Checks Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
# Alternative to pip-audit with different vulnerability database
# Usage: safety check
safety>=2.0.0

# Documentation
# -------------
# Sphinx: Documentation generator (optional, for API docs)
# Usage: sphinx-quickstart docs/
# sphinx>=6.0.0

# Development Utilities
# ---------------------
# IPython: Enhanced interactive Python shell
# Better than standard Python REPL for testing and debugging
# Usage: ipython
ipython>=8.0.0

# Python-dotenv (already in requirements.txt, listed here for reference)
# Load environment variables from .env file
# python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Note for Junior Developers:
# ---------------------------
# Development dependencies are tools that help you write better code,
# but aren't needed to run the actual program. For example:
#
# - black: Automatically formats your code so it looks consistent
# - ruff: Finds potential bugs and style issues
# - mypy: Checks that you're using the right types (like str, int, etc.)
# - pytest: Runs automated tests to make sure your code works
# - pip-audit: Checks if any dependencies have security problems
#
# To install all development tools:
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# To install only what's needed to run the program:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
